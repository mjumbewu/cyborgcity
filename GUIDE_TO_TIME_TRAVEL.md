A Brief Guide to Conversational Time Travel
===========================================

These are some lessons that I've picked up from hosting conversations from the future:

## Time Travel Tips (for all travellers)

- **Know who you are.** Choose your identity and stick to it. My recommendation is often to consider who you are (in real life) and and what makes you you *today*, and project that into your future self. Are you a programmer today? Imagine what it will mean to be a programmer in the future and embody that. Do you teach young children? 
- **Be courageous in the events you inject into the timeline.** These events *will* shape the conversation, but that's ok. Part of the fun of improvisational time travel is that you can never be quite sure where you'll end up.
- **Related to the previous tip, be specific about what happens.** It's more fun that way -- people have more to riff off of. Don't worry, you're not predcting, you're exploring.

## Host tips

As a host, it's your job to ensure that the future doesn't get out of hand. Here are a few tips:

- **Don't be too optimistic.** Too much optimism and you create a future that feels ersatz and lacks substance, because (1) try as we might, we could never actually solve all the problems of the future, and we'll definitely create new ones, and (2) even when we do create solutions, people don't universally feel the same about what the changes we make in the world mean ([here is an excellent example of that](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/06/27/on-views-of-race-and-inequality-blacks-and-whites-are-worlds-apart/)).
- **But don't be too pessimistic.** The inverse of the above also holds: if you don't inject enough hope into the conversation you get something that no one can get behind like we got that night, which was equally one-sided for the opposite reasons.
- **When you return from the future, allow some decompression time.** In spite of your best efforts, some future conversations will be heavy for different people for different reasons. It is good to allow some time after returning to the present for people to openly discuss how they feel about the particular future you visited.
