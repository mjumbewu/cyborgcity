A Brief Guide to Conversational Time Travel
===========================================

These are some lessons that I've picked up from hosting conversations from the future:

**Time Travel Tips**
- Know who you are. Choose your identity and stick to it. My recommendation is often to consider who you are (in real life) and and what makes you you *today*, and project that into your future self. Are you a programmer today? Imagine what it will mean to be a programmer in the future and embody that. Do you teach young children? 
- Be courageous in the events you inject into the timeline. These events *will* shape the conversation, but that's ok. Part of the fun of improvisational time travel is that you can never be quite sure where you'll end up.
- Related to the previous tip, be specific about what happens. It's more fun that way -- people have more to riff off of.
