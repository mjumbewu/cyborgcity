This is the initial announcement/invitation that I used. I simply set it up as a pinned post in a Facebook group that I created, containing the people that I invited to the dinners.

> You are invited to join in on a series of evenings of potluck dining and conversation. These dinners will each focus on a topic in relation to technological changes that occurred around the years 2000-2030. We will be doing some time traveling here and the discussions will be in retrospect as if we are currently in the year 2056.
>
> Everyone will choose a persona for the discussions. We’ll have a handful of personas to choose from, but you can make up your own if you choose. Since we will be traveling to the future, consider the persona as your anchor.
>
> As these are potluck dinners, we will be serving the main entrees, but appreciate contributions of appetizers and desserts as well as beverages. We encourage everyone to arrive by 6:45 so that we may have everyone around for the conversation.
>
> We’ve prepared a few questions to seed the conversation but encourage others to bring their own questions as well. To read up on this topics, we recommend checking out the evolving reading list at https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity/blob/master/DISCUSSION_READING_LIST.md

> If you are new to civic technology, we recommend (but do not necessarily endorse) the pieces at https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity/blob/master/DISCUSSION_READING_LIST.md#new-to-civic-tech
>
> For my own notes, these conversations may be recorded. Please let me know if you have any reservations about that.

> BACKGROUND
>
> I'm organizing a short series of dinners in preparation for a talk I'm giving in July. The title of the talk is "The City as Cyborg: a History of Civic Technology in the First Quarter of the 21st Century", and it will be given from the perspective of a historian in the year 2056 reflecting on the changes that have taken place during the period of the rise of the internet, mobile devices, etc. (e.g., as if we were reflecting on changes during the 1950s to the 1970s).
>
> What did this period look like? What shaped changes in the realms of privacy, security, and personal identity? What was the significance of our shifting relationship to devices? How did our relationship to cities become increasingly mediated by technology?
>
> Each dinner will focus on a specific sub-topic. These sub-topics may include things like media and activism, community organizing and local politics, social service provision, changes in the use of and interaction with physical space, and more.
