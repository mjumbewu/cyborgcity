# Reading List

The following topics should all be considered in relation to technological changes that occurred around the years 2000-2030. This list is partial and evolving. These topics were chosen based on the idea that in several decades time, these will be some of the defining issues from this period.

## Community Organizing and Local Politics

It is important to consider how we organize power and legitimacy in our physical communities.

## Privacy, Security, and Personal Data

This is a pivotal conversation when we talk about how we become cyborgs. It involves discussions such as: where we as individuals end and our devices begin, or whether there is significant distinction there at all; who owns the data about us as that data becomes increasingly detailed and comprehensive; what are the valid uses of data about us individually and collectively, especially as it relates to our experience within our environment (e.g., marketing and advertising) and with our governments (e.g., tracking and policing).

## Media, Advocacy, and Activism

Print journalism is struggling, and it is technically easier than ever for anyone to tell a story that the world can see. One of the most important aspects of these shifts is who holds the power to tell stories, to determine what stories get told, and to determine how the public receives those stories. Historically speaking, is this shifting media landscape a unique phenomenon? Are there other historical shifts that we can extrapolate from?

## Education, Social Services
