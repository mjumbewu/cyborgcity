# Cyborg City

I think it’s important to regularly attempt to historicize the present -- to imagine the present through the eyes of the future -- to recognize that we’re not living in the end of history, but constantly in the middle of it, constantly in transition.

To that end, I'm sharing the preparation and materials we  used to prepare for my _Cyborg City_ dinners. Your mileage will definitely vary, but we can get farther together, so shoot me an email if you have any questions!
