This is the initial email invitation/announcement. It was sent out to a large handful of people just to get an idea of what dates they might be able to make. In retrospect, the scheduling wasn't really necessary, but it did help to get people aware of/excited about the dinners.

> Hello everyone,
>
> I'm organizing a short series of dinners next month in preparation for a talk I'm giving in July. The title of the talk is "The City as Cyborg: a History of Civic Technology in the First Quarter of the 21st Century", and it will be given from the perspective of a historian in the year 2056 reflecting on the changes that have taken place during the period of the rise of the internet, mobile devices, etc. (e.g., as if we were reflecting on changes during the 1950s to the 1970s).
>
> What did this period look like?  What shaped changes in the realms of privacy, security, and personal identity? What was the significance of our shifting relationship to devices? How did our relationship to cities become increasingly mediated by technology? 
>
> Each dinner will focus on a specific sub-topic. These sub-topics may include things like media and activism, community organizing and local politics, social service provision, changes in the use of and interaction with physical space, and more.
>
> If this interests you, please fill out the following Doodle by this Friday, June 3: <link to doodle poll>. It's not a commitment -- I just want to get a sense of when people are available. There will be multiple meals and if you can come to one of them that is fine. Also, if there's anyone interested in the future of cities and technology that you think I should invite, please let me know.
>
> Looking forward to exploring the future with you,

This is the first version of the email invitation for a specific dinner. It changed over time, especially bits about providing personas (we stopped that: see "Know who you are" [here](https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity/blob/master/GUIDE_TO_TIME_TRAVEL.md#time-travel-tips-for-all-travellers)):

> You are invited to join in on an evening of potluck dining and conversation, the first in the **Cyborg City Series**.  This upcoming gathering will focus on the topic of **Community Organizing and Local Politics** and how they related to technological changes that occurred around the years 2000-2030.  Remember that we will be doing some time traveling here and the discussion will be in retrospect as if we are currently in the year 2056.
>
> We ask that everyone choose a persona for the discussion. We’ll have a handful of personas to choose from, but you can make up your own if you choose. For example, you may choose to be an elected official, an artist, a law enforcement professional, etc. Since we will be traveling to the future, consider the persona as your anchor.
>
> As this is a _potluck dinner_, we will be serving the main entree (it’s taco night!), but appreciate contributions of appetizers and desserts as well as beverages. We encourage everyone to arrive by 6:30 so that we may have everyone around for the conversation.
>
> We’ve prepared a few questions to seed the conversation but encourage others to bring their own questions as well. To read up on this week’s topic, we recommend checking out the evolving reading list at https://github.com/mjumbewu/cyborgcity/blob/master/DISCUSSION_READING_LIST.md#community-organizing-and-local-politics

> If you are new to civic technology, we recommend (but do not necessarily endorse) the following pieces:

> For my own notes, these conversations may be recorded. Please let me know if you have any reservations about that.
